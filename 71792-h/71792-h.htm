<p>The writer of these volumes was advised by a friend
to prefix an Advertisement to them, explaining their
design. Her answer to that friend was to this effect:</p>

<p>“Those for whom they are designed will not need an
explanation; and others will not regard it. The mother,
who is surrounded by smiling prattlers, will enter with
spirit into my first Dialogues: will declare that they
are such as she has wished for a thousand times; and
that she esteems herself obliged to me, for having condescended
to march in shackles, for the sake of keeping
pace with her infant; she will be aware of some difficulty
in the task; she will (to pursue the metaphor)
allow that it is not easy to move gracefully, when we
shorten our steps to those of a child. She will, therefore,
pardon such inaccuracies as arise from the necessity
of confining the language to short words.</p>

<p>“For the rest, I am persuaded (from experience and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
the remarks of the most judicious mothers) that a book
of this kind will be acceptable.</p>

<p>“The mother who herself watches the dawn of reason
in her babe; who teaches him the first rudiments of
knowledge; who infuses the first ideas in his mind;
will approve my <span class="smcap">Cobwebs</span>. She will, if she be desirous
of bringing her little darling forward; (and where it can
be done with ease and satisfaction, who is not?) she will
be aware of the consequence of the first lessons, where
nothing meets the eye of the learner but objects with
which he is already familiar; nothing arises to his mind,
but subjects with which he begins to be acquainted; sentiments
level to his capacity, explained in words which
are suited to his progress.</p>

<p>“Such is the <em>Cobwebs</em> designed to be; if such it be,
it will meet the smile of Mothers. It was written to
please a set of children dear to the writer; and it did
please them; and in the hope that it may be agreeable
to other little people, it is given to the public.”</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> I love to have him go with me.</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> Here is a cake for you.</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> Nice cake! See the dog! how
he wags his tail now! Why do you
wag your tail? Why do you look so?
Why does he wag his tail so much?</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> To beg for some cake. His
tail says, I love you; you have a cake,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
and I have none: will you not be good
to me? Will you not give some of your
cake to your poor dog?</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> Poor dog! do you want some
cake? take a bit. Here! I hold it to
him, but he does not take a bit.—Take
some; O, he has got it all! he was not
to take all. Fie, <em>Wag</em>! to take all!
Now I have none left. You are rude,
<em>Wag</em>.</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> He did stay some time.—Here,
I will give you a plum-cake.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> Now you are to have none,
<em>Wag</em>. You are to have none of this
cake; you were rude.</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> He did not know that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
was not to take all. He can not know
all that you say.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> Well, you may have a bit of
this. I will take a bit off and give it to
him.</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> Do so. You are a good
boy. We must be kind to all. We
must give to them who want.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> Why do you ask for more?</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> He has not had a meal to-day.
He had not a bit till now. You
have had food.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> I hope he will have meat at
noon. I will ask cook to give him a
bone; and he may have some milk, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
he can have some bran. Cook will boil
them for him. Poor dog! he can not
ask as <em>we</em> can, so I will ask for him.
<em>Wag</em>, I wish you could talk. Why does
he bark at poor men?</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> When he sees a man whom
he does not know, then he says, “Who
are you?—who are you?—why do you
come?—what do you do here?—I am
at home—I must tell the folks—I must
tell that you are here—I will call our
folks to look at you. Come out, man;
come out, maid—see who this is.—Bow,
wow, wow, wow!”</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> Does the dog say all that?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
Why does he stop as soon as the folks
come out?</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> He is so wise as to know
that he need bark no more then. If he
means to call them out, he will stop
when they are come out.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> <em>Wag</em>, why do you gape when
you are hot? Can <em>you</em> tell me why he
does so?</p>

love to give him milk; once I saw a
fawn, I do not mean in a park, but I
saw a <em>tame</em> fawn; the old doe was dead,
so we fed the fawn at home. We kept
him a long time, but he bit off the buds.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> Why is one duck by itself?</p>

<p><em>Maid.</em> The duck sits; she has a nest
just by. I must feed her: she will not
go far from her nest. The rest can get
food. You may give her some corn;
we will get some for her. Come.</p>

<p><em>Girl.</em> What a neat coat! I love a
blue silk. And her hat! I love a doll
in a hat. What sort of a cap have
you, miss! but a poor one; but it is not
much seen. She has some soil on the
neck. I can rub it off, I see. No, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
will not do; I must not wet her skin.
What sort of a foot have you? O! a
nice one; and a neat silk shoe: a blue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
knot, too; well, that is what I like; to
suit her coat. I am fond of blue, too.
Now, miss, when I have you home with
me, then I am to be your maid; to wait
on you. Will not that be nice! I will
take care of you, and keep you so neat!
and I will work for you; you can not
sew, nor hem; and I will read to you in
my new book; and I will take you out
with me when you are good. You shall
sit by me near the tree, on a low seat,
fit for you. I wish you to walk. Can
not I make you walk? so—step on—see
how my new doll can walk!</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> You will pull off her legs,
my dear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p><em>Girl.</em> Now if I had a pin to pin this
sash back. Stay, I can tie it. O me!
see! here is a bag for her work! who
has seen the like? a bag for her work!
I <em>must</em> have this doll—if you like it, I
mean.</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> You must then work for her.
You will have much to do. To make
and mend all that your doll will want to
wear. Will not you wish her in the
shop? I fear that you will; <em>you</em> who
are so fond of play.</p>

<p><em>Girl.</em> Work for my doll will not tire
me.</p>

<p><em>Girl.</em> You are so good! pray let me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
kiss you. I must kiss <em>you</em> too, my dear
doll, for joy.</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> Yes, you may.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> Let me see, here is a goat.
Do look at his face; how like it is to a

wool on it, just like my lamb that I feed
at home. And here is a cock. Can you
crow? Crow and tell us that it is time
to rise. Can you not? What a tail he
has! a fine tail! No, I will not have
that, for his tail will soon be off. Some
part of it is come off now.</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> You must not pull; you do

<p><em>Boy.</em> I did not pull hard.</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> You are a long time.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> O, here is a fine horse! I like
this horse. I like his long tail. You
shall not have your tail cut—no, nor
your ears: but you can not feel. Come,
sir, walk and trot. Do you move well?
I will rub you down, and give you oats
and hay, and chop straw for you. I will
be good to you, not whip you much—No
more than just to say—Now go on;—nor
spur you, nor gall your poor skin;
no, nor let the hair rub off. So—you
set your tail well; but if you did not,
Tom must not nick you; no, nor yet
dock your poor tail; you will want it to
keep the flies from you when it is hot.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
I see poor <em>Crop</em> toss his head all day;
he does it to keep the flies from him;
but it is all in vain, he can not keep them
off. I will be good to you; I will tend
and feed you; and I will not ride too
hard, and hurt your feet; nor trot on
hard road, so as to make you fall and
cut your knees; but I will pat your neck
when I get up, and I will make you
know me: so that you will turn your
head, and seem to like to have me get
on your back. At night, you must have
a warm bed. When I have rode you in
the day, I will see that you have good
corn, and hay, and straw; and Tom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
must wash the hot sand out of your poor
feet, so that they may not ache, and
make you grow lame.</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> I can not but give you the
horse, as you seem to plan so well for
him; I hope you will be good and kind
to all things.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> I do not care now for the lamb,

<p><em>Mother.</em> My dear, I would have you
know your own mind; if you get the
trick to like now this, now that, and now
you know not what, it will do you harm
all your life.—So it is that boys and men
spend too much; so it is that they act
like fools. I would give you all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
toys in the shop, if it were for your good
to have them: the horse you have;
now take something else; take the book,
do you like the book?</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> I do; I thank you, mamma. I
will keep the horse, and I will give the
book to Jack. O! my dear horse, how
I love you!</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> Yes, sir, where shall we go?</p>

<p><em>Father.</em> Let us go by the farm yard
into the fields.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> See! a horse and a cow stand
by the fence in the yard. Now we are
in the field. Is it full of nettles?</p>

<p><em>Father.</em> No, not so, it is hemp.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> What is that for, papa?</p>

<p><em>Father.</em> To make cloth of; the stalk
has a tough peel on it, and that peel is
what they make thread of. The thread
they weave, and make strong cloth.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> I want to know all the trees:
pray what leaf is this?</p>

<p><em>Father.</em> That is an oak; that bush<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
is May; we call it too White-thorn; it
blooms late in May; its fruit are called
Haws; so we call it Haw-thorn. The
birds eat the fruit. That is Black-thorn;
that blooms soon in Spring; it has a
white bloom, and has then few or no
leaves. The fruit is a sloe. They are
like a small blue plum; but so sour
that you can not eat them.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> What is this?</p>

<p><em>Father.</em> Wild rose; its fruit are
Hips; they are kept, and we take them
for coughs. That is broom; it has a
bloom like a pea in shape, but it is
yellow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> There is a bush of it in bloom.</p>

<p><em>Father.</em> No: that is Furze, such as
you see on heaths. Feel this; Broom
does not prick like this.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> I will keep a leaf of each to
show to James.</p>

<p><em>Father.</em> You may put them in a
book, and write what I have told you.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> I will get all sorts of plants;
and I will mark by each the name, the
place, the bloom, the time when it blows,
and the use which is made of it.</p>

<p><em>First Girl.</em> Why do you like it best?</p>

<p><em>Second Girl.</em> It is my dear mother’s

<p><em>First Girl.</em> My doll’s best dress is
brown with a stripe of blue; and she
has a white, wrought with a moss rose,
a pink, and a large bunch of leaves:

now; she must leave it off soon.</p>

<p><em>Second Girl.</em> Why does she wear it
so long?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p><em>First Girl.</em> I had a half-dollar to
buy her a piece of silk; as I went in the
coach with my aunt to buy it, we met a
poor child who had no clothes, but the
worst rags which you can think.</p>

<p><em>Second Girl.</em> And you gave it to
her. My doll should wear her old gown
for a long time, for the sake of such a
use to put my half-dollar to.</p>

<p><em>First Girl.</em> I had more joy in that,
than I could have had in my doll’s new
dress. Dolls can not feel the want of
clothes.</p>

will ask for some fruit to give to you.</p>

<p><em>Second Boy.</em> I have a pear tree;
that tree is mine, and we get nuts from it.</p>

<p><em>First Boy.</em> We have grapes, and figs,
and plums; but I love a peach best, it
is so full of juice.</p>

<p><em>Second Boy.</em> We have none of them;

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p><em>Lady.</em> If it be clean, some poor child
would be glad of it; that is a large
piece—We will give chaff to the ducks.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> This bread is made of wheat;
wheat grows in the earth; wheat is a
grain. I am to see <em>Tom</em> bind a sheaf:
and when <em>Tom</em> goes home to shear his
sheep, I am to see him. He will throw
them in a pond: plunge them in! Our
cloth is made of wool; how can they
weave cloth, and how can they stain it?
How light this chair will be! it will not
weigh much.</p>

<p><em>Lady.</em> Who heard the clock; I
meant to count it. I left my watch in
my room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> Why did you leave it?</p>

<p><em>Lady.</em> The chain was broken last
night.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> I like to have my couch of
<em>green</em>. <em>Jane</em> loves green. What do you
call this?</p>

<p><em>Lady.</em> A blush, or faint bloom;
some call it bloom of peach; it is near
white. That is quite white.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> May I sit on the grass? I
love to sit in the shade, and read my
book.</p>

<p><em>Lady.</em> The earth is as dry as a floor
now.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> If I could reach those sweet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
peas I would get some seed; they are
such nice round balls. <em>Jane</em> likes them
to play with.</p>

<p><em>Lady.</em> You may go now and fetch a
quill for me; do not put it in your
mouth. While you go, I shall go on
with the work.</p>

<p>A little girl was eating her supper;
it was bread and milk, with some honey.
“Pray,” said the little girl, “who makes
honey for my supper?”</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> The bees collect it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p><em>Girl.</em> Where do they find it?</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> In the flowers.</p>

<p><em>Girl.</em> Where do the bees live?</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> Those which supply us with
honey, live in a hive.</p>

<p><em>Girl.</em> What is it made of?</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> Ours are made of straw.</p>

<p><em>Girl.</em> Pray, mamma, tell me a great
deal about the bees, whilst I eat my
milk.</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> In the night, and when the
weather is cold, they keep in the hive.
When the sun shines, and the days are
warm, they fly abroad. They search
far and near for such flowers as supply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
them with honey or wax. Of the wax
they make cells which we call comb.
In some of the cells they lay up stores
of honey to support them in the winter,
when they can not venture out to seek
for food. In some of the cells they
nurse their young ones, who have no
wings. They are very neat creatures;
they keep the hive quite clean. They
carry out the dead bees.</p>

<p>The next morning this same little girl
was eating her breakfast. It chanced
that the maid had let fall a drop of honey
as she mixed her milk; and a fly
came and stood on the edge of her basin
to suck it.</p>

<p>The good child laid aside her spoon
to avoid frightening the poor fly.</p>

<p>What is the matter, <em>Sarah</em>? are you
not hungry?</p>

<p>Yes, mamma; but I would not hinder
this little fly from getting his breakfast.</p>

<p>Good child! said her mother, rising
from her tea; we will look at him as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
eats. See how he sucks through his
long tube. How pleased he is!</p>

<p>Mother, can not flies make honey?
said the little girl.</p>

<p>“No,” said her father, “they are like
you, they can not make honey, but they
are very fond of eating it.”</p>

<p>What do flies do, father?</p>

<p><em>Father.</em> They are as idle as any little
girl of you all; they frisk and buzz
about all the summer, feeding upon what
is made by others.</p>

<p><em>Girl.</em> And in winter what do they do?</p>

<p><em>Father.</em> Creep into some snug corner.</p>

<p><em>Girl.</em> But what do they eat then?</p>

<p><em>Father.</em> They sleep, and want no food.</p>

</div>

<p>A little boy saw a spider; its legs
were all packed close to its body; the
boy thought it was a bit of dirt, and was
going to pick it up.</p>

<p>His father stopped him, lest he should
chance to hurt the spider; he told him
that the poor creature had rolled himself
up from fear; that if he stood still he
would soon see the spider move.</p>

<p>The little boy kept close and quiet
some time, watching the spider; he saw
it unfold one leg, then another, till at last
they were all loose, and away it ran.
Then the little boy ran after his father,
and heard the history of spiders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>He told him a great deal about them.
Then he talked to him of other insects,
which disguise themselves to escape the
dangers which they meet with.</p>

<p>He picked up a wood-louse, and laid it
gently in his little hand. There, said
he, you see the wood-louse roll itself into
a little ball, like a pea: let it lie awhile
and when it thinks that you do not observe
it—</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> Ah! it unrolls.—O! it will run
away: shall I not hold it?</p>

<p><em>Father.</em> No, my dear, you would
hurt it.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> I would not hurt any creature.</p>

<p><em>Father.</em> No! surely—He who made
you, made all creatures to be happy.</p>

</div>

<p>A boy was walking with his mother;
he saw a bird fly past, with some food
in its mouth.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> Is not that bird hungry? for I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
see that he carries his meat fast in his
mouth.</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> She is a mother bird, and
has young ones in her nest.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> Who makes the nest?</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> The old birds.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> How do they make the nests?</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> Some make their nests of
sticks; some of dry leaves; some use
clay; some straw: they use all sorts of
things; each kind of bird knows what
is fit for its use.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> What do they make nests for?</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> To nurse their young in.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> And are they warm?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> The old birds line them
with moss, with wool, or with feathers,
to make them warm and soft.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> Where do they get all these
things?</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> They fly a great way to
fetch them; and sometimes they pluck
their own breasts to supply down for
their young to lie upon.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> How kind they are!</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> So kind are good parents to
their children.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> Pray why do the birds sing?</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> One old bird sings whilst
one sits on the eggs.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> Why do they sit on the eggs?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> To keep them warm, so that
they may hatch.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> What do you mean by that,
pray, mother?</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> The young birds break the
shells and come out.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> What do they do then? do they
fly?</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> Not at first: babes, you
know, cannot walk.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> But what do young birds do?</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> They lie in the nests, and
gape for food.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> And do they get it?</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> The old birds fly far and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
near to fetch it. You saw one with some
in its bill.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> I see a bird now with some in
its mouth.</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> Do not make a noise, lest
you fright the poor thing.—Hush! hush!—let
us creep gently, and see the bird
go to her nest.</p>

<p><em>They saw the bird alight on a bush
just by: she hopped from twig to twig
till she got to the nest: she gave the little
worm which she had in her beak to her
young, and then flew away in search of
more.</em></p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> Now may I talk?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> Yes, my dear;—are you not
pleased to see the birds?</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> Yes, mother.—When will the
little ones fly?</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> When they have got all
their feathers.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> How will they learn?</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> The old birds will teach
them to fly as I taught you to walk.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> I hope the little birds will
always love their mothers. I shall always
love you; mother, pray kiss me.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_HAPPY_FAMILY">THE HAPPY FAMILY.</h2>
</div>

<p>There were eight boys and girls of
the name of <em>Freelove</em>; their kind parents
taught them to do as they were bid in
all things. They were the happiest
children in the world; for, being used to
control, they thought it no hardship to
obey their friends. When one of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
had a mind to do anything, and was not
sure whether it would be right, he went
in to inquire, and was always content
with the answer. If it was proper, he
was certain to have leave: and if it was
not proper, he had no longer a wish to
do it, but was glad that he had asked.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. <em>Freelove</em> took great pains
with their children, and taught them, as
soon as they could learn, all that was
proper for their age; and they took
delight in learning, so that it was a
pleasure to teach them.</p>

<p>Such a family is the most pleasing
scene upon earth.</p>

<p>The children were all very fond of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
each other. No one had an idea of
feeling joy in which the rest did not
share. If one child had an apple, or a
cake, he always parted it into eight
pieces; and the owner kept the smallest
for himself; and when any little treasure
was given which could not be so divided,
the rest were summoned to see it, to
play with it, and to receive all the pleasure
which it could afford.</p>

<p>The little folks were fond of books:
the elder ones would often lay aside their
own, to read aloud to the younger ones
in such as were suited to them. In
short, they were a family of perfect love.
Each boy had a little piece of ground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
for a garden, in which he might work to
amuse himself. It would have made you
smile to see how earnest they were at
their work—digging, planting, weeding,
and sometimes they had leave to water.
Each was ready to lend any of his tools
to his brother. Each was happy to assist
in any plan, if his brother needed
help.</p>

<p>The boys did the chief work in their
sisters’ gardens; and their greatest joy
was to present little nosegays to their
mother and sisters.</p>

<p>There were sheep kept upon the lawn;
the pretty creatures were so tame that
they would eat out of a person’s hand.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
You may believe that the children were
very fond of feeding them; they often
gave them their little barrow full of
greens. There was no danger of the
little folks not thinking to perform so
pleasing a task as this. One day <em>George</em>
was reading aloud to a younger brother,
whose name was <em>William</em>—‘Do as you
would be done by.’</p>

<p><em>William.</em> Pray what does that mean?</p>

<p><em>George.</em> I will show you now; you
hear the sheep bleat.</p>

<p><em>So he ran and got some greens, and
gave to the sheep.</em></p>

<p><em>George.</em> You see what it is to do as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
we would be done by; the poor sheep
are hungry and I feed them.</p>

<p><em>William.</em> I should like to feed them;
but I have no greens.</p>

<p><em>George.</em> Here are some of mine:
take some, and give to them.</p>

<p><em>William.</em> I thank you, brother; now
you do to me as you would wish to be
done by.</p>

<p><em>The next day</em>, William <em>saw a poor
woman standing on the outside of the
iron gates. She looked pensive; and
the child said</em>:</p>

<p>What do you want, poor woman?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p><em>Woman.</em> A piece of bread; for I
have had none to eat.</p>

<p><em>William</em> had a bit in his hand; he
had just begun to eat it. He stopped,
and thought to himself—If I had nothing
to eat, and I saw a person who
had a great piece of bread, what should
I wish?—that he should give me some.
So the good child broke off all but a very
little bit, (for he was very hungry) and
said,</p>

<p>You shall have this bread which the
maid gave me just now. We should
‘do as we would be done by.’</p>

<p>Good boy! said his mother, who
chanced to pass that way, come and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
kiss me. <em>William</em> ran to his dear
mother, and hugged her; saying, I am
never so happy as when you say, good
boy.</p>

<p><em>Mother.</em> I was seeking for <em>Mary</em> to
tell her that <em>Mrs. Lovechild</em> has sent to
have you all go with us: but for your
reward, you shall carry the message to
the rest. Go; I know it will give you
great pleasure to rejoice your brothers
and sisters.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_FAIR">THE FAIR.</h2>
</div>


<p><em>James</em> and <em>Edward Franklin</em>, with
their <em>Sisters</em>, had leave to walk about,
and amuse themselves in a fair. They
saw a great many people who seemed
very happy, many children merry and
joyous, jumping about, and boasting of
their toys. They went to all the stalls
and bought little presents for those who
were at home. They saw wild beasts;
peeped in show-boxes; heard drums,
trumpets, fiddles, and were as much
pleased with the bustle around them, as
you, my little reader, would have been,
had you been there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <em>Franklin</em> had desired them not
to ride in a Merry-go-round, lest they
should fall and hurt themselves.</p>

<p>Did you ever see a Merry-go-round?
If you never passed through a country
fair, I dare say you never did.</p>

<p>As they passed by, the children who
were riding called, “will you ride? will
you ride?”</p>

<p><em>James.</em> No, I thank you, we may
not.</p>

<p><em>Edward.</em> I should like it, if I might.</p>

<p>One girl called, “See how we ride!”
One said, “O! how charming this is!”
One boy said, “You see we do not fall!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p><em>James.</em> I am not fearful; but my
mother forbade us to ride.</p>

<p>One boy shouted aloud, “Come, come,
you must ride; it will not be known at
home. I was bid not to ride, but you
see I do.”</p>

<p>Just as he spoke, the part upon which
he sat broke, and down he fell.</p>

<p>In another part of the fair, the boys
saw some children tossed about in a
Toss-about.</p>

<p>They were singing merrily the old
nurse’s ditty:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Now we go up, up, up,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Now we go down, down, down,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Now we go backward and forward,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Now we go round, round, round.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>
<p>The voices sounded pleasantly to
<em>Ned’s</em> ear; his heart danced to the notes;
jumping, he called to his brother <em>James</em>,
“Dear <em>James</em>! look! if I thought our
mother would like it, I would ride so.”</p>

<p><em>James.</em> My dear <em>Ned</em>! I am sure
that mother would object to our riding
in that.</p>

<p><em>Ned.</em> Did you ever hear her name
the Toss-about?</p>

<p><em>James.</em> I am certain that if she had
known of it, she would have given us the
same caution as she did about the Merry-go-round.</p>

<p><em>Ned</em> paused a moment; then said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
“How happy am I to have an elder brother
who is so prudent!”</p>

<p><em>James</em> replied—“I am not less happy
that you are willing to be advised.”</p>

<p>When they returned home, each was
eager to relate his brother’s good conduct;
each was happy to hear his parents commend
them both.</p>

<p>Mr. Steady was walking out with his
little son, when he met a boy with a
satchel on his shoulder, crying and sobbing
dismally. Mr. Steady accosted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
him, kindly inquiring what was the
matter.</p>

<p><em>Mr. Steady.</em> Why do you cry?</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> They send me to school: and
I do not like it.</p>

<p><em>Mr. Steady.</em> You are a silly boy!
what! would you play all day?</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> Yes, I would.</p>

<p><em>Mr. Steady.</em> None but babies do
that; your friends are very kind to you.—If
they have not time to teach you
themselves, then it is their duty to send
you where you may be taught; but you
must take pains yourself, else you will
be a dunce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p><em>Little Steady.</em> Pray, may I give him
my book of fables out of my pocket?</p>

<p><em>Mr. Steady.</em> Do, my dear.</p>

<p><em>Little Steady.</em> Here it is—it will
teach you to do as you are bid—I am
never happy when I have been naughty—are
you happy?</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> I cannot be happy; no person
loves me.</p>

<p><em>Little Steady.</em> Why?</p>

<p><em>Mr. Steady.</em> I can tell you why;
because he is not good.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> I wish I was good.</p>

<p><em>Mr. Steady.</em> Then try to be so; it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
is easy; you have only to do as your
parents and friends desire you.</p>

<p><em>Boy.</em> But why should I go to school?</p>

<p><em>Mr. Steady.</em> Good children ask for
no reasons; a wise child knows that his
parents can best judge what is proper;
and unless they choose to explain the
reason of their orders, he trusts that they
have a good one; and he obeys without
inquiry.</p>

<p><em>Little Steady.</em> I will not say <em>why</em>
again, when I am told what to do; but
will always do as I am bid immediately.
Pray, sir, tell the story of Miss <em>Wilful</em>.</p>

<p><em>Mr. Steady.</em> Miss <em>Wilful</em> came to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
stay a few days with me; now she knew
that I always would have children obey
me: so she did as I bade her; but she
did not always do a thing as soon as she
was spoken to; and would often whine
out <em>why?</em>—<em>that</em> always seems to me like
saying—<em>I think I am as wise as you are;
and I would disobey you if I durst</em>.</p>

<p>One day I saw Miss <em>Wilful</em> going to
play with a dog, with which I knew it
was not proper for her to meddle; and I
said. Let that dog alone.</p>

<p>Why? said Miss—I play with <em>Wag</em>,
and I play with <em>Phillis</em>, and why may I
not play with <em>Pompey</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>I made her no answer—but thought
she might feel the reason soon.</p>

<p>Now the dog had been ill-used by a
girl, who was so naughty as to make a
sport of holding meat to his mouth and
snatching it away again; which made
him take meat roughly, and always be
surly to girls.</p>

<p>Soon after Miss stole to the dog, held
out her hand as if she had meat for him,
and then snatched it away again. The
creature resented this treatment, and
snapped at her fingers. When I met her
crying, with her hand wrapped in a napkin.
“So,” said I, “you have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
meddling with the dog! Now you know
<em>why</em> I bade you let <em>Pompey</em> alone.”</p>

<p><em>Little Steady.</em> Did she not think you
were unkind not to pity her? I thought—do
not be displeased, father—but I
thought it was strange that you did not
comfort her.</p>

<p><em>Mr. Steady.</em> You know that her
hand was not very much hurt, and the
wound had been dressed when I met
her.</p>

<p><em>Little Steady.</em> Yes, father, but she
was so sorry!</p>

<p><em>Mr. Steady.</em> She was not so sorry
for her fault, as for its consequences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p><em>Little Steady.</em> What, father?</p>

<p><em>Mr. Steady.</em> Her concern was for
the pain which she felt in her fingers;
not for the fault which had occasioned it.</p>

<p><em>Little Steady.</em> She was very naughty,
I know; for she said that she would
get a pair of thick gloves, and <em>then</em> she
would tease <em>Pompey</em>.</p>

<p><em>Mr. Steady.</em> Naughty girl! how ill-disposed!
then my lecture was lost upon
her. I bade her while she felt the
smart, resolve to profit by <em>Pompey’s</em>
lesson; and learn to believe that her
friends might have good reasons for
their orders; though they did not think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
it proper always to acquaint her with
them.</p>

<p><em>Little Steady.</em> I once cut myself
with a knife which I had not leave to
take; and when I see the scar, I always
consider that I ought not to have
taken the knife.</p>

<p><em>Mr. Steady.</em> That, I think, is the
school-house; now go in, and be good.</p>

<p>Mrs. <em>Lovechild</em> had one room in her
house fitted up with books, suited to
little people of different ages.—She had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
likewise toys, but they were such as
would improve, as well as amuse her
little friends.</p>

<p>The book-room opened into a gallery,
which was hung with prints and pictures,
all chosen with a view to children.
All designed to teach little folks while
they were young; in order that when
they grew up, they might act worthily.</p>

<p>There were written accounts of each
picture, with which her ladyship would
often indulge good children.</p>

<p>Sometimes she walked about herself
and explained a few of the pictures to
her little guests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>One day I chanced to be present
when she was showing a few of them
to a little visiter; and I think my young
reader may like to hear what passed.</p>

<p><em>Mrs. Lovechild.</em> That is Miss <em>Goodchild</em>.—I
have read an account of her,
written by her mother.</p>

<p><em>Miss.</em> Pray, madam, what was it?</p>

<p><em>Mrs. Lovechild.</em> It is too long to
repeat now, my dear; but I will tell you
a part.—She was never known to disobey
her parents; never heard to contradict
her brothers or sisters; nor did
she ever refuse to comply with any request
of theirs.—I wish you to read her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
character, for she was a pattern of goodness.</p>

<p><em>Miss.</em> Pray, madam, was she pretty?</p>

<p><em>Mrs. Lovechild.</em> She had a healthful
color: and her countenance was
sweet, because she was always good-humored.—That
smile on her mouth
seems to say—I wish you all happy; but
it was not for her beauty, but her goodness,
that she was beloved: and on that
account only did I wish for her picture.</p>

<p><em>Miss.</em> Pray, madam, why is that boy
drawn with a frog in his hand?</p>

<p><em>Mrs. Lovechild.</em> In memory of a kind
action which he did to a poor harmless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
frog.—You shall hear the whole story.—I
was taking my morning walk pretty
early one day, and I heard a voice say,
“Pray do not kill it; I will give you this
penny, it is all I have, and I shall not
mind going without my breakfast, which
I was to have bought with it.”</p>

<p>“You shall not lose your meal!” exclaimed
I; “nor you, naughty boys, the
punishment which you deserve for your
cruel intention.”</p>

<p><em>Miss.</em> Pray, madam, what was the
good boy’s name?</p>

<p><em>Mrs. Lovechild.</em> <em>Mildmay!</em> he was
always a friend to the helpless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p><em>Miss.</em> How cruel it is in a great boy
to be a tyrant!</p>

<p><em>Mrs. Lovechild.</em> Dunces are often
cruel.—My young friend redeemed a
linnet’s nest from a stupid school-fellow,
by helping him in his exercise every day
for a fortnight, till the little birds were
flown.</p>

<p><em>Here a servant entered the gallery,
and announced company, which put an
end to Mrs. Lovechild’s account of the
picture.</em></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_HEDGE-HOG">THE HEDGE-HOG.</h2>
</div>

<p>Master William Gentle was riding on
the back of his dog Cæsar, when his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
grandfather called to him and invited
him to take a walk. They went out
together, and as they were walking, they
met some boys who had a hedge-hog,
which they were going to hunt.—Mr.
<em>Gentle</em> ordered them to release it.—The
boys pleaded that the hedge-hog would
injure the farmers by sucking their cows,
and that it therefore ought to be killed.</p>

<p><em>Mr. Gentle.</em> If it were proper to
deprive the animal of life, it would
be a duty to do it in as expeditious a
manner as possible, and very wicked to
torment the poor creature; but the accusation
is false, and you are unjust as
well as cruel.—Release it this instant!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p><em>William.</em> Will the hedge-hog be
glad when he gets loose?</p>

<p><em>Grandfather.</em> Very glad.</p>

<p><em>William.</em> Then I shall be glad too.</p>

<p><em>Grandfather.</em> I hope that you will
always delight in making other creatures
happy: and then you will be happy
yourself.</p>

<p><em>William.</em> I love to see the dog happy,
and the cat happy.</p>

<p><em>Grandfather.</em> Yes, surely; and you
love to make them happy.</p>

<p><em>William.</em> How can I make them
happy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p><em>Grandfather.</em> By giving them what
they want, and by taking kind notice
of them, and when you get on Cæsar’s
back again, as he lets you ride, do not
strike him, but coax him gently.</p>

<p><em>William.</em> Can I make my brothers
and sisters happy?</p>

<p><em>Grandfather.</em> You can each of you
make yourself and all the rest of the
children happy, by being kind and good-humored
to each other; willing to oblige,
and glad to see the others pleased.</p>

<p><em>William.</em> How, pray?</p>

<p><em>Grandfather.</em> If you were playing
with a toy, and <em>Bartle</em> wished to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
it, perhaps you would part from it to
please him; if you did, you would
oblige him.</p>

<p><em>William.</em> Should not I want it
myself?</p>

<p><em>Grandfather.</em> You would be pleased
to see him delighted with it, and he
would love you the better, and when
<em>George</em> goes out, and you stay at home,
if you love him as well as you do yourself,
you will be happy to see his joy.</p>

<p><em>William.</em> I shall be happy to see
his joy.</p>

<p><em>Grandfather.</em> Your parents are always
watching over you all, for your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
good; in order to correct what is amiss
in your tempers, and teach you how
you ought to behave; they will rejoice
to see you fond of each other, and will
love you all the better.</p>

<p><em>William.</em> Grandpa, I remember that
my brother wrote a piece last <em>Christmas</em>,
which you called Brotherly Love.—I
wish I could remember it.</p>

<p><em>Grandfather.</em> I recollect it;—you
shall learn to repeat it.</p>

<p><em>William.</em> I shall like that; pray let
me hear it now, sir.</p>

<p><em>Grandfather.</em> You shall.</p>

<p>“The children of our family should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
be like the fingers on a hand; each help
the other, and each in his separate station
promote the good of the whole.
The joy of one should be the joy of the
whole. Children in a house should
agree together like the birds in a nest,
and love each other.”</p>

<p><em>William.</em> I thank you grandpa: I
remember <em>Watts’</em> hymn:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Birds in their little nests agree,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">“And ’tis a shameful sight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“When children of one family,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">“Fall out and chide and fight.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The master <em>Rebels</em> often fight; many
say that it is jealousy that makes them
do so.—Pray, grandpa, what is jealousy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p><em>Grandfather.</em> A passion which I
hope will never enter your breast. Your
excellent parents love you all equally,
and take care to make it appear that
they do so. A good parent looks around
with equal love on each child, if all be
equally good, and each be kind to the
rest. When a family is affectionate,
how happy is every member of it! each
rejoiceth at the happiness of the rest,
and so multiplies his own satisfactions.
Is any one distressed? the tender and
compassionate assistance of the rest mitigates
where it cannot wholly relieve
his pain!</p>

<p><em>Second Girl.</em> I shall like the play, and it
will teach <em>Charles</em> to spell well.</p>

<p><em>First Girl.</em> That is its use: we have
sports of all kinds to make us quick: we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
some to teach us to count; else I could not
have been taught to do sums at three years
old.</p>

<p><em>Second Girl.</em> Were you?</p>

<p><em>First Girl.</em> Yes; I was through the four
rules by the time that most boys learn that
two and two make four.</p>

<p><em>Second Girl.</em> I wish you would teach me
some of your sports; that I could teach
<em>Charles</em>.</p>

<p><em>First Girl.</em> Print words on a card; on the
back write the parts of speech; let it be a
sport for him to try if he can find what each
one is; let him have the words, and place
them so as to make sense; thus I give you
these words:</p>

<p class="center no-indent bold"><em>you</em>, <em>done</em>, <em>do</em>, <em>be</em>, <em>would</em>, <em>by</em>, <em>as</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>Place them in their right order, and make</p>

<p class="center no-indent bold"><em>Do as you would be done by</em>.</p>

<p>Or give him two or three lines: here and
there scratch out a word; let him tell what
those words must be to make sense.</p>

<p><em>Second Girl.</em> The card on which you have
a, b, c, and so on, might have a, b, c, made
with a pen at their backs, to teach written
hand.</p>

<p><em>First Girl.</em> I have a set of those; I could
read my mother’s writing when I was four
years old.</p>

<p><em>Second Girl.</em> I will buy some prints or
cuts, and paste at the back of cards, for our
little ones; so they will soon learn to distinguish
nouns. On one side shall be <span class="allsmcap">DOG</span>;
I will ask what part of speech is that?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
<em>Charles</em> will say, Is it not a noun?—He will
turn the card, and find a cut.</p>

<p><em>First Girl.</em> Let us prepare some words
of all kinds; we can lay sentences for little
ones to read. For <em>Lydia</em>, we will place them
thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container bold">
<div class="poetry fs120">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>Our new dog.</em></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>An old cat.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>My mother says that three words are as
much as a child could read in a breath at
first.</p>

<p><em>Second Girl.</em> Where there is a house full
of young folks, it might be good sport to teach
and learn in these ways.</p>

<p><em>First Girl.</em> It is; we play with our words
thus; mother gives to one some words; he
is to place them so as to make sense: one is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
to parse them: one to tell more than the parts
of speech, as the tense, mode and so on, of
the verbs.—<em>George</em> and I have false <em>English</em>
to correct; verse to turn to prose; we write
out a passage which we like; we write letters
upon given subjects; we read a story,
and then write it in our own words.</p>

<p><em>Second Girl.</em> Do you repeat much?</p>

<p><em>First Girl.</em> To strengthen our memories,
we learn to repeat passages in <em>prose</em>—we also
repeat <em>verse</em>, and read it aloud.</p>

<p><em>Second Girl.</em> That is a great pleasure.</p>

<p><em>First Girl.</em> Yes, and my mother reads
aloud to us; this teaches us to read with propriety;
and she often stops to inquire whether
we understand any expression which is not
perfectly plain.</p>
